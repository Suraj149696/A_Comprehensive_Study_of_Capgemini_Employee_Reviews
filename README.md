# A_Comprehensive_Study_of_Capgemini_Employee_Reviews


Project Overview
This project aims to analyze employee reviews of Capgemini to uncover trends and patterns in employee satisfaction. The primary objectives include identifying key factors influencing satisfaction, developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to extract meaningful keywords from the reviews, and creating a recommendation system that offers tailored suggestions based on the insights. Additionally, the project includes building a multiclass sentiment classification model to categorize employee ratings into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project provides actionable insights to help improve organizational strategies for enhancing employee engagement and satisfaction.

Steps Taken
Data Collection and Cleaning: Ensured reliable and accurate data ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key factors influencing employee satisfaction and detected data patterns.

NLP Model Development: Extracted significant keywords and phrases from employee feedback to derive insights.

Recommendation System Implementation: Built a system providing personalized suggestions based on employee departments and locations.

Multiclass Sentiment Classification: Developed an LSTM-based model to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy.

Tools Used
Excel

Python (including NLP and ML libraries)

Power BI for visualizations

Challenges
Missing Values: Some important columns had irreplaceable missing values that may impact model reliability.

NLP Limitations: Difficulty in fully understanding context affected keyword extraction, sentiment classification, and recommendations.

Imbalanced Data: Sentiment class imbalance presented challenges in model training, potentially introducing bias.

Generalization Issues: The classification modelâ€™s performance may vary with new data due to limited sentiment diversity in training samples.

Visualizations Included
Count plot of ratings across different features

Donut plot representing employees by department

Correlation heatmap of key variables

Word clouds for likes and dislikes extracted from reviews

Key Results
Employee Satisfaction Factors: Work-life balance, skill development, salary, benefits, job security, and career growth were identified as significant contributors to employee satisfaction. Positive perceptions in these areas strongly correlated with higher satisfaction.

Areas for Improvement: While employees showed satisfaction with work-life balance, job security, and career growth, salary and benefits received neutral ratings, indicating potential areas for improvement.

Keyword Extraction: NLP techniques such as TF-IDF effectively extracted relevant keywords from reviews, enhancing understanding of employee sentiments and key themes.

Recommendation System: Personalized recommendations based on departmental and locational insights enable targeted strategies to improve employee satisfaction.

LSTM Model Performance: Achieved 79.05% accuracy in sentiment classification, demonstrating robust performance in categorizing employee reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
